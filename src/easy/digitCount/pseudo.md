# Pseudo Code Solution
We should break it down into multiple small problems. So,
1. Convert the number to string.
2. Get the length of the string.
3. Return the length as the number of digits.
identify inputs, outputs, and any code you think you'll need:
inputs: a number
outputs : the number of digits as a number
