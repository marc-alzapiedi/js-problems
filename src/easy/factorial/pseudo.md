# Pseudo Code Solution

1. Define a function that returns an output
    -->The function will be called numFactorial.

2. Make a variable and define it as an empty array
    -->The array will be used to push the values of the numbers in a loop

3. Write a for loop
    -->The for loop will act as a counter that counts up from the input
    -->The counter will pushe all the numbers in the array

4. Make a variable that contains the result
    -->The variable will start with the number 1
    -->The result wil be returned when the function is called
    -->The variable will compute the product of all the numbers in the array

5. Make another for loop
   -->The for loop will take each number from the array with numbers and take the product. 

6. Return and console.log() the result
