# Pseudo Code Solution

1. Define a function
   -->The function will be called numRemainder

2. Create a for loop
    -->The for loop should count numbers from 1 to 20
    -->The counting will also be used in the next loop
    so that it can be checked if there is a remiander
    in the division

3. Make another for loop
   -->This for loop is to count all real positive numbers until we find
   the first number that is divided and has no remainder

4. Return the number
 -->The loop stops when we find the smallest number with
 no remainder, and we return that number.
